# ðŸ“¡ Measuring the Temperature of the Sun with a TV Antenna

This repository contains code, data, and documentation for a project in which a **TV antenna** was used as a telescope to measure the **temperature of the Sun**. The experiment is based on **solar radiometry**, leveraging radio frequency signals from the Sun to estimate its thermal properties.

The final report for this project is accessible [here](Solar_Radiometry.pdf)

## ðŸ”¥ Project Overview

In this project, we explore how a simple TV antenna can act as a **radio telescope** to capture the Sun's electromagnetic emissions. By analyzing these signals, we estimate the **effective temperature of the Sun** using radiometry principles.

### **Key Components of the Experiment:**
- **TV Antenna**: Used to receive radio waves from the Sun.
- **Data Acquisition**: Recorded signals and processed using R.
- **Radiometry Analysis**: Used to estimate the temperature from signal strength.
- **Results & Visualization**: Presented in the `.qmd` and `.pdf` files.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Signal Collection**  
   - A TV antenna was aligned to detect radio waves from the Sun.
   - Data was collected over a defined period to analyze signal intensity.

2. **Data Processing in R**  
   - Raw signal data was processed and analyzed.
   - Temperature estimation was done using radiometric equations.

3. **Visualization & Results**  
   - Plots and graphs generated in `SolarRadiometry.qmd`.
   - The final report in `Solar_Radiometry.pdf`.
